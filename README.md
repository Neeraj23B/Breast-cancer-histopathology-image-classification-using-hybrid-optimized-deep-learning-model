Detect if a person has Breast Cancer using Histopathological images with the help of deep learning model [Convolution neural network]â€‹

## Introduction
Breast cancer is a disease that begins when healthy cells in the breast undergo abnormal growth, forming a mass or tumor. Early diagnosis is crucial for successful treatment and improved survival rates. Histopathology, which involves examining tissue samples, provides valuable insights into the nature of the disease.

## Objective
The primary objective of this research is to design and develop a robust classification model based on deep learning techniques. The model aims to classify histopathological images into Malignant and Benign categories, aiding in the early detection of breast cancer. Various deep learning architectures, including VGG16, VGG19, Inception, and custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with and without filters, were explored during the study.

## Importance of Histopathology
Histopathology plays a pivotal role in cancer diagnosis by allowing professionals to analyze cellular changes that reveal the underlying cause of a patient's illness. Pathologists make diagnoses by examining small tissue samples from different organs. This method not only aids in diagnosis but also guides treatment options, leading to more effective and targeted interventions.

## Deep Learning Model
The deep learning model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically exploring architectures such as VGG16, VGG19, Inception, and custom CNNs. The research compares the performance of these models with and without filters to identify the most effective approach for breast cancer histopathology image classification.

## Model Evaluation
Through experimentation with different architectures and configurations, the research concludes that the CNN model without filters demonstrates superior accuracy in classifying histopathological images. The model is trained to distinguish between Malignant and Benign cases, providing a valuable tool for early cancer detection.
